# AI-Powered Task Management & Recommendation System

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains two enterprise-level data science and machine learning projects developed during my 4-month internship at **Infotact Solutions**. These projects are designed to solve real-world problems using NLP, machine learning, and recommendation techniques.

## 📌 Project 1: AI-Powered Task Management System

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Develop an intelligent task management system that automatically classifies, prioritizes, and assigns tasks based on user behavior, task descriptions, deadlines, and workloads.

### ✅ Key Features
- **Task Classification** using Naive Bayes and SVM models.
- **Priority Prediction** using Random Forest and XGBoost.
- **NLP Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stemming, stopword removal.
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF and Word2Vec embeddings.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall.
- **Visualization**: EDA, classification reports, confusion matrices.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Git & GitHub for version control

## 📌 Project 2: Personalized Recommendation System

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Build a recommendation engine that suggests personalized content/products to users based on their behavior and interactions.

### ✅ Key Features
- **Collaborative Filtering**: User-based and Item-based models.
- **Matrix Factorization**: SVD and NMF implementations.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: TF-IDF on product metadata.
- **Hybrid System**: Combined recommendation strategy.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, MAE, Precision@K.

### 📊 Dataset
- [MovieLens Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) (user-item interaction data)

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Surprise, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebooks / Google Colab for model training

## 📈 Results & Deliverables
- Trained models and evaluation results for both projects.
- Summary visualizations, dashboards, and mock interfaces.
- Final reports documenting workflows, results, and key insights.
